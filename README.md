# rubiks-cube-solver

A Computer Vision-based Rubik's Cube Solver that uses edge and color detection and the Kociemba algorithm to solve the cube.

## User Manual

Run `python3 stream.py` to start the live stream version of the solver. You can see an empty structure of the cube on the top left corner.
Adjust your cube's positioning until the colors are identified and are outlined in the app. Then, press **SPACE** to add it to the structure. Do so in the order of the top side, the left side, the front side, the right side, the back side, and the bottom side. After all sides are added and confirmed, press **ENTER** to start the solving phase. If you make mistakes of adding faces, you can always delete them by pressing the **DELETE** button. You can press **ESC** to exit at any time.
